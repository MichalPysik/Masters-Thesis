# Master's Thesis - Large Language Models for Traffic Surveillance Video Understanding

Existing systems for searching and analyzing traffic surveillance footage often rely on predefined event detection methods and lack the ability to interact with users through natural language. The main goal of this thesis is to create such system by utilizing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and related technologies, namely multimodal embedding models, both of which have seen rapid advancements in recent years. The system is designed to support multiple models of both types, enabling flexible integration and comparison. Furthermore, the available models are benchmarked specifically in the domain of traffic footage to evaluate their performance and suitability for practical deployment.
